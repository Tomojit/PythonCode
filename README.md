PythonCode
==========

Various Python Code for AI topics(A* search algorithm, Constraint Satisfaction Problem, Bayesian Network etc)
rush-hour-astar.py : I implemented A* algorithm in this code. 
classroomSched.py : In this program I implemented a Constraint Satisfaction Problem for class room scheduling
classroomFOL.py : In this program I implemented the same class room scheduling but using First Order Predicate Logic.
security.py : This is quick implementation for Baysian Network.

Note extra Python Modules are needed to run these codes. If you atre interested to any of these program please email me. I'll
give you the extra modules.
